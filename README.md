Ys_ShipmentComment — Magento 2 Extension

Adds shipment comments to checkout and orders.

Overview:
Ys_ShipmentComment extends Magento 2 checkout and order flow by allowing customers to leave a shipment/delivery comment during checkout.
The comment is stored on the quote and transferred to the order when placed.
It is visible in:
- Admin Order View,
- Customer Account Order View
- optionally included in order confirmation emails ({{var shipment_comment}}).
- The module supports both Luma and headless setups (GraphQL mutation included).

How It Works:
1. Rendering at Checkout

During checkout layout generation, a LayoutProcessor plugin injects a new UI component:
shipping-step > shippingAddress > shippingAdditional > ys-shipment-comment

2. Config propagation

Dedicated ConfigProvider exports settings into checkoutConfig object, for example:
{
  enabled: true,
  requireEnabled: true,
  requiredMethods: ["flatrate_flatrate"] <= array of selected methods in config
}

3. Frontend logic (shipment-comment.js)

Reads the above config and observes the selected shipping method.

Dynamically toggles:
isVisible(true/false) — field shown only for selected methods.
isRequired(true/false) — required if “Require Shipment Comment” = Yes.
Adds inline error message when validation fails.
Uses a RequireJS mixin to inject the comment into the REST payload.
The field’s current value is also mirrored into quote.shippingAddress.extension_attributes.shipment_comment for compatibility.

4. Server-side validation

Plugin on Magento\Checkout\Model\ShippingInformationManagement intercepts
saveAddressInformation():
- Reads the comment from extension_attributes.
- Checks if the selected method requires comment.
- Saves comment to quote.shipment_comment or throws an error if value is required but missing.

5. Order submission

Observer (sales_model_service_quote_submit_before) copies quote.shipment_comment
to the sales_order.shipment_comment field.

6. Admin and customer display

Admin Order View: Displays the comment under order information.
Customer Account Order View: Displays comment in a new “Shipment Comment” block.
Both pages support inline styling via the CSS config values.

7. Email integration

Plugin on Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Email\SenderBuilder adds
{{var shipment_comment}} so that it can be used in email templates.
